What I did today:
- Created blog article objects using an object constructor function.
- Created the markup for the article template in the DOM and used jQuery to clone the template for each article.
- Successfully got the articles to display in the DOM.
- Added functionality to sort articles by most recent publish date
- Added basic style sheets.

Blocking Points:
- Displaying the # of days ago an article was published from the current date of an article
- Displaying images in a reasonable manner.
- Adding static text without using html markup in the js file and/or not having it display before the first article.

- sabrina helped with getting objects to display in the dom
- natlie helped with sorting the articles based on most recent date and linking the author url to the author name by traversing the dom
